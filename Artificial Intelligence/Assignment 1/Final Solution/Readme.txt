Programming Language used - c++

The code is structured as follows - 
1. There is a Graph class that stores all the information related to the graph like vertices, edges in vectors
2. The graph class contains 
	a. addEdge function to add edges and vertices to the vectors
	b. UCF function which calculates the shortest optimal path
	c. displayPath function that displays the shortest path and distance 

How to run the code -
1. compile the code using the following command
	g++ main.cpp -o find_route
2. The above command creates an executable file named find_route
3. Run the exectuable using ./find_route
4. You will get Enter file name propmt - When you get this instruction, then please enter the name of the file which contains the path information. The input file should be a text file. The input file should be places in the same directory as the executable file.
5. Next prompt you get is Enter the start vertex : . In this enter the name of the start city
6. Next prompt you get is Enter the end vertex : . In this enter the name of the end city
7. Based on the cities searched you will get the respective outputs
